Lets say we have a old record player. It only plays vinyl records. But we also have a collection of CD's. To play the CD's on the record player , we need an adapter. The adapter converts the CD's digital signal into an analog signal that the record player can understand.

This is exactly how the Adapter pattern works. Its a way to make objects with incompatible interfaces work together.
