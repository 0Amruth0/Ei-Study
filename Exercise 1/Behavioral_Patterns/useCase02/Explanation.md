Let's say we have a remote control for a AC.
We want to be able to turn on or turn off the AC with buttons.
Additionally we want to be able to be able to increment the AC temperature or decrement it.

Each button on the remote control is a command that performs an action. The remote can store the command history to be able to  undo previous action.
