Behavioral patterns mainly focus on how objects communicate and interact with each other. 

Here lets talk about the useCase01, i.e the WEATHER STATION.

Imagine a weather station that measures temperature. Lets say we have different devices like the phone, TV, computer etc that need to update automatically when the weather station detects a change in the temperature.

Here we are considering the weather station to be the subject and devices as observers, which makes it a OBSERVER PATTERN. whenever the weather station's temperature changes, it notifies all observers to update their devices.
