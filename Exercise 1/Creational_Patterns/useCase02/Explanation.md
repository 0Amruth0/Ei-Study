 Lets say we have a pet store and we have different animals for sale, like dogs and cats. When a customer asks for a specific pet, we dont go to the specific kennel and pick one. Instead, we ask one of the workers to bring us the requested animal. 

 This is similar to the Factory Method Pattern. it's more or less a way to create objects without specifying their exact type directly. We delegate this object creation to a factory method.
